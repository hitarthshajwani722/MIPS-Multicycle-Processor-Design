# MIPS-Multicycle-Processor-Design

This repository contains the Implementation of a Single Cycle and Five-staged Multi-cycle 32-bit MIPS Processor using Verilog HDL, implemented and tested on Xilinx Vivado. The Processor executes R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions, and is also capable of detecting and correcting Data and Control hazards.
